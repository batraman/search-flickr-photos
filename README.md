# Search Flickr Photos

Bootstrapped using CRA

## To Do:

- [x] Base Project with Visual Components, Redux, Router
- [x] Integrate Flickr API (Make sure to NOT commit API_KEY)
- [x] Save Search Results + Show them when searching
- [x] Load More Results (Infinite Scrolling)
- [x] Show modal with caption

## Later:
- [x] Explain why search results are not shown when typing
- [x] Prevent duplicate calls on the same query
- [ ] Show API errors to users
- [x] Responsiveness
- [ ] Image Placeholders 
- [x] No results empty state
- [ ] Loaders
- [x] press enter to search text on no search results
- [ ] Documentation. Documentation. Documentation. 
- [ ] Figure out when Flickr API returns different URL photo formats and handle those cases
- [ ] Query Based Routing for search
- [ ] Remove Reactstrap Dependency

## Just for fun:
- [ ] Cache search results for 24 hours
- [x] Masonry layout either(sucks when it comes to normal layout) using three columns or the library
       - Can add some nice animations too
- [ ] OLDDDDDDDDD Browser support
- [ ] Tests (why is this in just for fun?)
- [ ] Styled components
